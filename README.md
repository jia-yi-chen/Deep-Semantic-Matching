# Detail Enhanced Multi-scale Retinex algorithm (DEMSR)

A deep learning method.
The code Providing lighting maps for input images, to guide the correct drawing style (stroke, colow, texture) to put on correct place.


* good to express lighting , 
* good to protect scene structure, because of protection of lighting
* good to draw lanscapes, sky, and human faces

## PYTHON Implementation

A PYTHON implementation of master thesis "". will be uploaded soon.


## Some Results

### Task #1: Lanscape Painting

* robust to input photos containing a lot of sunlight (e.g., drawing sky)

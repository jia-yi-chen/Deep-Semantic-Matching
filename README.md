# Illumination-guided Non-photorealistic Neural Style Transfer

A semi-supervised learning method.
The code Providing lighting maps for input images, to guide the correct drawing style (stroke, colow, texture) to put on correct place.
Doing PatchMatch on 
calculating lighting context.

* good to express lighting , 
* good to protect scene structure, because of protection of lighting
* good to draw lanscapes, sky, and human faces
This is a PYTHON implementation of of master thesis "". will be uploaded soon.

## Requirements

* python 3
* pytorch 1.0+
